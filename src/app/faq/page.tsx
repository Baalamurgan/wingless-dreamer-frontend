            The internet has brought significant advancements and
            transformations to the operations of publishers. At Wingless
            Dreamer, we leverage print-on-demand technology, eliminating any
            unnecessary prints and reducing waste. Consequently, our paperbacks
            and ebooks are priced affordably.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, the cost of Wingless Dreamer paperbacks ranges from USD
            10 to USD 15, while ebooks are priced between USD 5 and USD 10.
            These prices encompass shipping costs, printing expenses, and other
            essential third-party fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it&apos;s worth noting that our color prints may be
            slightly more expensive due to the inherent costs involved. The
            price range for color prints is generally between USD 18 and USD 25.
